## One-Liner Pitch

**CoachFlux is a team of 10 mood-adaptive AI coaches that deliver deeply personalized life coaching — available 24/7 for a fraction of traditional coaching costs.**

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> Personal coaching transforms lives — but at $150–500 per session, it's out of reach for most people. CoachFlux changes that. We built a team of 10 specialized AI coaches, each with a unique personality and expertise, powered by Google's Gemini AI. The app reads your emotional state, adapts its coaching style in real time, and gives you evidence-based techniques — not generic advice. Chemistry scoring matches you with the right coach. A Growth Garden visualizes your progress. It's real coaching, for everyone, starting free. Pro is $12.99/month.

## Full Description

CoachFlux is a premium AI coaching platform that brings together 10 specialized AI coaches — each with distinct expertise, personality, and methodology — into a single beautiful app. Built with Flutter and powered by Google Gemini Flash 2.0, CoachFlux delivers mood-adaptive conversations that dynamically adjust tone and approach based on the user's emotional state.

The app features proprietary chemistry scoring to match users with their ideal coach, real-time character-by-character streaming for natural dialogue, an insights dashboard with mood trend analytics, a coaching journal with auto-generated summaries, and a Growth Garden that visually blooms as users hit milestones. Users can even build custom AI coaches from scratch using the Coach Builder.

CoachFlux operates on a freemium model: free users receive 50 messages per day with 3 coaches, while Pro subscribers ($12.99/month) unlock unlimited access to all coaches, Coach Builder, advanced analytics, and priority AI responses. Subscriptions are powered by RevenueCat.

Built for the RevenueCat Shipyard 2026 Hackathon, CoachFlux targets the intersection of the $20B coaching industry and the consumer AI revolution — making professional-grade personal development accessible to everyone.
